title: "How & Why"
---

## Goals
- Begin to develop a personal philosophy about why we design things, and how we approach that work;
- Acquire a working vocabulary of concepts and elements in graphic design, and learn how we can consider those concepts and elements when used to communicate ideas, establish tone, and influence readers/users;
- Form a habit of noticing the presence of elements and concepts, and reflecting on how that presence affects our experience, and shapes our design work.
