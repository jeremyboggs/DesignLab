title: "How & Why"
---

## Goals
- Begin to develop a personal philosophy about why we design things, and how we approach that work;
- Acquire a working vocabulary of concepts and elements in graphic design, and learn how we can consider those concepts and elements when used to communicate ideas, establish tone, and influence readers/users;
- Form a habit of noticing the presence of elements and concepts, and reflecting on how that presence affects our experience, and shapes our design work.

## Reading
- [The Shape of Design](https://shapeofdesignbook.com/) by Frank Chimero.

## Prompts to Consider

- Can you recall an instance recently, or anytime in the past, when you designed something? Even if you didn't think of yourself as designing something. How did you do it? _Why_ did you do it? What were the results after, for you and for anyone else who might have encountered your designed thing?
- Share a particular sentence or part of Chimero's book that resonates with you. How might you return to that idea in your own work?
