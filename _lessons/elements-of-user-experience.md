## Goals

- Review the _Elements of User Experience_ and consider how we might approach each for our own work.
- Begin planning our own personal portfolio site and research project site.

## Prompts

- Read [Chapter 2 from _Elements of User Experience_](http://www.jjg.net/elements/pdf/elements_ch02.pdf) and come prepared to discuss your own definitions of each of the five layers he details.
- Review Garret's [original diagram of user experience elements](http://www.jjg.net/elements/pdf/elements.pdf) and think about how the work we've done to this point fits in with any of the diagram's layers.

## Resources

- Brown, Dan. _Communicating Design_. 
- Garret, Jesse James. _Elements of User Experience_. 2000.
